NAME
    Dist::Inkt::DOAP - various DOAP-related roles for Dist::Inkt

DESCRIPTION
    Dist::Inkt is a framework for writing your own distribution builder. It's
    a simple class that makes an empty directory, creates a MANIFEST file
    listing the contents of the directory, and then compresses it into a
    tarball.

    Which seems pretty useless. However, it provides tonnes of hooks that can
    be used by roles applied to the class. This distribution provides a
    collection of roles that help you populate the distribution's metadata
    (META.json, Changes, etc) from DOAP.

  The Straight DOAP
    So what is DOAP? This explanation is lifted from Wikipedia
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOAP>.

    *DOAP (Description of a Project) is an RDF Schema and XML vocabulary to
    describe software projects, in particular free and open source software.*

    *It was created and initially developed by Edd Dumbill to convey semantic
    information associated with open source software projects.*

    *It is currently used in the Mozilla Foundation's project page and in
    several other software repositories, notably the Python Package Index.*
